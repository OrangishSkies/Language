## ✨ Writing System (SVG Glyphs)

The language uses **vector-based symbols** instead of a traditional typed alphabet.  
Each symbol exists as an SVG file and is automatically displayed anywhere its name is referenced in the database.

✅ Crisp visuals at any size  
✅ Custom artistic style  
✅ Designed for a unique conlang identity
